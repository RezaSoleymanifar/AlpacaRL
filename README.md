### Description
neural is a Python open source project for real-time equity and cryptocurrency trading using deep reinforcement learning. This library provides seamless end to end support for data acquisition, designing, training and deploying deep reinforcement learning algorithms in trading API's. neural currently supports Alpaca API as its default trading API.

### Mission
This project is designed to provide a framework to standardize the MLOps workflows for designing, deploying and maintaining DRL algorithms that can trade stocks. This will reduce the code requirements to create production ready Machine Learining models and allows more foucs on model discovery and hyperparameter optimization.

### About me
I'm a data sicentist and I am passionate about practical use of Deep Reinforcement Learning for trading stocks. I created this toolset for me and other enthusiasts like me to discover AI models that can learn how to trade stocks with minimal code requirements.
