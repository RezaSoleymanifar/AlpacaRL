<h1>neuralHFT: <span style="font-size: 70%;">deep reinforcement learning for high frequency trading.</span></h1>


neuralHFT is a pythonic libarary that is written and optimized for high-frequency stocks and crypto trading. Available market environments are fully compatible with stable versions of state of the art DRL algorithms implemented in [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with no boilerplate code required. neuralHFT by default offers seamless integration with [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/) allowing standalone and end-to-end support from training and launching HFT algorithms in live market environment.

The Alpaca API provides low-latency, commission-free trading of stocks and crypto assets, making it an ideal platform for high-frequency trading strategies. 

This comprehensive support through a pythonic interface allows users to efficiently develop, test, and deploy high-frequency trading strategies in a standalone manner, without the need for additional tools and services.
