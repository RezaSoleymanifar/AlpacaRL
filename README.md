## Description
neural is a Python open source project for real-time equity and cryptocurrency trading using deep reinforcement learning. This library provides seamless end to end support for data acquisition and designing, training and deploying deep reinforcement learning algorithms in trading API's. neural currently supports Alpaca API as its default trading API.

## Mission
this project is designed to be a framework to standardize the MLOps workflows for desigigning, deploying and maintaining DRL algorithms that can trade stocks. This will reduce the code requirements to create production ready DRL agents and allows more foucs on model discovery and hyperparameter optimization.


I'm data sicentist and I am passionate about using Deep Reinforcement Learning for trading stocks. I wanted to create a playground for other enthusiasts like me to discover models that are good at trading stocks with minimal code requirements.
